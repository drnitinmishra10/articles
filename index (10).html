            <p><strong>1. 💰 Money can’t buy a woman’s love.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>2. 💍 Money can’t keep her or guarantee her loyalty.</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, money opens doors. It can get you attention. But it can’t keep a woman. What keeps her is your masculine presence, your character, and your game.</p>
            <p>Look at billionaires—Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk. They had everything money could buy. But they still faced divorce, heartbreak, and betrayal. Why? Because women don’t love the bank account. They love the man behind it.</p>
            <p>If you’re broke and blaming your lack of money for your failed relationships, you’re delusional. The real problem isn’t your wallet—it’s your weakness.</p>
            <p>You don’t understand female psychology. You don’t know how to make her feel feminine while you remain unshakably masculine. You lack charisma, certainty, and the raw edge that makes women respect and desire a man.</p>
            <p>A man with true game—who knows how to lead, how to command respect, how to stay unmovable—will keep her love even when he’s not rich. But a man with only money and no masculine core? She’ll use him until she finds better.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember this:</strong> Money buys attention. Masculinity wins loyalty.</p>
