        <h2>Why these rules matter</h2>
        <p class="intro">Presence isn’t loud. It’s consistent. These rules are practical behaviors and mindset cues that separate ordinary men from men who carry dignity, influence, and self-control. Read them with intention — the value is in practicing them daily.</p>
      </div>

      <ol class="rules">
        <li>
          <h3>1. Do not return to a woman who betrayed you</h3>
          <p>Once trust is broken, it rarely heals fully. Preserve your self-respect — don’t allow yourself to be a backup plan or accept a repeating pattern of betrayal.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>2. Do not allow any woman to talk to you without regard</h3>
          <p>Accepting disrespect erodes your boundaries. Address disrespect calmly and firmly — your standards signal how you expect to be treated.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>3. Stand up when giving a handshake</h3>
          <p>A small ritual that communicates confidence and dignity. Physical posture shapes how others perceive you before you say a word.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>4. Stop spending money you do not have just to impress people</h3>
          <p>Impression built on debt is temporary. Financial discipline protects your future and your reputation when hard times come.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>5. Do not finish what you did not pay for</h3>
          <p>Whether a meal or a service — honor contracts and avoid freeloading. It’s a simple code that demonstrates integrity and self-control.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>6. Always aim to improve your life</h3>
          <p>Commit to incremental growth. Learn, refine habits, and measure progress — every day should make you a little better than yesterday.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>7. Protect those who depend on you and honour those who walk beside you</h3>
          <p>Loyalty and protection are not weaknesses. They’re the backbone of meaningful relationships and the true measures of a man’s value.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>8. Take a short pause before answering questions</h3>
          <p>A measured pause projects calmness and thoughtfulness. It lets you choose words with intent and shows you are in control.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>9. Never beg for love or attention</h3>
          <p>Seeking validation from others weakens your presence. Model self-sufficiency — the right people will gravitate to you without persuasion.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>10. Exercise at least four times weekly</h3>
          <p>Physical strength fuels mental clarity and confidence. Regular training sharpens discipline and signals that you take care of yourself.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>11. If you were not invited, stay where you are</h3>
          <p>Know where you belong and where you are not needed. Self-respect is recognizing your boundaries and protecting your dignity.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>12. Always carry some cash</h3>
          <p>Practical preparedness avoids embarrassment and shows that you can handle small emergencies without depending on others.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>13. Dress properly at all times</h3>
          <p>Your appearance is an immediate statement. Dress intentionally — it’s a silent language of competence and care.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>14. Listen well, nod when needed, and keep strong eye contact</h3>
          <p>Active listening and confident eye contact build authority and trust more effectively than interrupting or pontificating.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>15. Build many streams of income</h3>
          <p>Financial resilience comes from diversification. Multiple income streams reduce dependency and increase freedom of choice.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Practice, don’t perform.</strong> These rules matter only if they become habits. Start small: pick one rule, apply it for a week, then expand. Power that lasts is quiet — forged by consistency, not theatre.
